# Vaultier as a FUSE file system
Mapping Workspaces, Vaults and Cards as folders, and secrets as files.

## Install
For ubuntu is needed package:
 libfuse-dev
 libattr1-dev
 python3.6-dev

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Use
python vaultfs.py mnt/

It is slow when starting and each time we enter in a directory not already seen. Then it uses cache to go faster.

## Dev
kill /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-udisks2-volume-monitor while testing
